GumPad started out as a simple text processor to convert several texts available in ITRANS  (`http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/`) format into Telugu and Devanagari. While doing this, I noticed that the UNICODE code charts for Indian languages are structured in a way that most Indian languages can be easily transliterated amongst each other. I took advantage of this feature to support transliteration into Telugu and a few other languages. Of these, I am only familiar with Telugu and Hindi (Devanagari). Consequently, I have not been able to verify the transliteration to the other languages but, I suspect it is pretty accurate for the common block of Indic vowels and consonants.

An Add-In for Microsoft Word is also available. BETA versions targeted at Word 2007 and Word 2010 have been posted. Please download these Add-Ins only if you are willing to bear with any minor issues with using BETA code. If you decide to brave it, the install process itself is fairly straight forward. Download the zip file containing the Add-Ins, expand, it and run setup.exe. Once installed, you will be able to see a "Transliteration" group on the "Home" tab of the Word Ribbon UI. You can uninstall the Add-In at any time from Windows Control Panel ==> Add/Remove programs.
